    "The difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific exception type is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bare except block: It is written as except: without specifying any exception type. This block catches all types of exceptions that occur within the try block. It can be used as a catch-all to handle any unexpected exceptions. However, using a bare except block is generally discouraged because it makes it difficult to determine the specific type of exception that occurred and can hide programming errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific exception type: It is written as except ExceptionType: where ExceptionType is the specific type of exception you want to handle. By specifying the exception type, you can handle different exceptions in different ways and provide more specific error handling and recovery mechanisms.\n",

It is recommended to have more specific except blocks before more generic ones to handle exceptions in a targeted manner."
